            <h2>A research tool to compare versions of the rules of the US. House of Representatives</h2>

            <p>
                Under Article I of the Constitution, the House of Representatives and Senate are granted broad discretion to establish “the Rules of Its Proceedings.” While the Senate is a continuing body with continuing rules, the House of Representatives updates its rules at the beginning of a new Congress. The current rules of the House of Representatives span more than 1,500 pages. But the rules package, which is passed at the beginning of a new Congress, includes important changes to how the chamber approaches legislation and conducts other business. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Traditionally, understanding how House rules change over time has been the work of academics, the staff of the Congressional Research Service, and other experts who have studied House rules packages and understand how changes affect the legislative body’s workings. But the American people deserve to better understand how the House of Representatives works, especially given the growing bipartisan recognition of the importance of modernizing Congress.

            <p>
                The Foundation for American Innovation created this website to allow users to study and compare changes in House rules over time. The site allows users to track changes of the text of different rules from the 106th to 118th Congress. We will gradually add rules from earlier Congresses, which are in the process of being transcribed.
                In the future we may add additional rules sets, such as committee rules, House Democratic Caucus rules,  and House Republican Conference rules.

            </p>

            <p>Rules data can be messy. Rules can be consolidated or removed across different Congresses. The number of the rule can change, requiring one to map out the rules across different years.</p>

            <p>
                Our current data set of House rules is accessible as a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C7-Duvd1w2RQH0YnwyCRRFW0g8qrQ6oHmW4DGyab9aI/edit?usp=sharing">CSV file</a> or as a <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='Rules_combined_df_master.xml') }}">XML file</a>.
